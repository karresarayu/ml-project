Water Potability
 A Machine Learning Project using Python to check water potability, using ensemble Learning
 – Using elbow method found the optimal value of k for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions
 – Bagging and Boosting algorithms to increase accuracy, The visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn
 – Published it live using GitHub pages
